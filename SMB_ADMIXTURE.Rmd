# SMB ADMIXTURE Analysis 

## Libraries needed for analysis
```{r setup, echo = FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(devtools)
library(pophelper)
```

## Genomics Metadata
```{r METADATA}
#Read in filtered SMB Genomics metadata. This file should include 92 individuals that passed filters for low genotype calls
genomics_metadata <- read_excel("../../metadata/sample_metadata/genomics_metadata_filtered.xlsx")

#Clean metadata

##All sample data
genomics_metadata <- as.data.frame(genomics_metadata)
genomics_metadata <- column_to_rownames(genomics_metadata, "na")

##Only samples that were pure by original admixture analysis (this analysis is conducted below, but I create the metadata set here for consistency in the R workflow)
genomics_metadata_pure <- genomics_metadata %>%
   filter(adm_status == "pure")

#Filter data file for only Smallmouth Bass and INCLUDING the SMB X SPB (Spotted Bass) hybrid (BFC10)
